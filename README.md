# news-api to support Black Owned Companies!

With Juneteenth around the corner I decided to deploy a easy project that could help spread Black Excellence has a front-end built with VueJS and communicates with a NodeJS / Express back-end interfacing with a MongoDB database. 


# What is ExpressJs?
ExpressJs simply put, it's a web framework for Node.Js - stolen from the official docs. Taylor Otwell (Laravel's creator) once said, "Developers build tools for developers". ExpressJs was built for developers to simplify Node APIs.

# What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database. It's completely document-oriented. A NoSQL database allows you to store data in the form of JSON and any formats. If you want to learn more about MongoDB, please checkout their docs.

# What is Vue.js?
Vue.js lets you extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js directives offers functionality to HTML applications, Vue.js provides built-in directives and user defined directives.

# What I did:
I decided to create a MEVN stack (Vue.js + Node.js + Express + MongoDB) example with a CRUD Application. The back-end server uses Node.js + Express for REST APIs, front-end side is a Vue client with Vue Router and axios. The API allows you to save articles to MongoDB by clicking the earth icon (on the right of the articles). 

# How to work
Open a terminal and cd to the root project directory and run:

npm start
The main site page should then load at http://localhost:3000/
